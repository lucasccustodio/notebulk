A note taking application made with Flutter using Entitas framework for state management and Hive as database. Features: Context-aware status bar that can apply actions in batch to a group (hence the name ;)), database backup/restoration, search system with support for multiple terms (tags), reminders as Smart list that knows when one is late and custom theme with support for Dark mode toggling. Also experimental support for Linux.
